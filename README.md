==============
Userspace tools and docs for bcachefs

Bcachefs is an advanced new filesystem for Linux, with an emphasis on reliability and robustness
and the complete set of features one would expect from a modern filesystem.

This repo primarily consists of the following:

- bcachefs tool, the reason this repo exists.
- {mkfs,mount,fsck}.bcachefs utils, which is just wrappers calling the corresponding subcommands
  in the main tool
- docs in the form of man-pages and a user manual

Please refer to the main site for [getting started](https://bcachefs.org/#Getting_started)
An in-depth user manual is (also) found on the [official website](https://bcachefs.org/#Documentation)

Version semantics
-----------------

The tools relies on an expected disk format structure which is reflected by your current kernel version.
Disk format can be upgraded or downgraded automatically by the kernel, if needed.

- Any patch-level change means no disk format change
- Any minor-level change means a potential disk format change which **is not breaking**
- Any major-level change means **breaking changes**

Build and install
-----------------

Refer to [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)

Testing
-------

Besides manual testing, which is also encouraged, there are also a number of
checks defined that are used for CI (e.g. github actions).

These checks can be listed using `nix flake show`. You can, for example, test
the current state of the repo or test every patch before publishing them.

```shell
$ nix flake check
$ git rev-list origin/master.. | xargs -I{} nix flake check "git+file://$(pwd)?rev={}"
```
