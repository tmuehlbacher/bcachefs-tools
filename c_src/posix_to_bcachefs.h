/*
 * This header exports the functionality needed for copying data from existing
 * posix compliant filesystems to bcachefs. There are two use cases:
 * 1. Creating a new bcachefs filesystem using `bcachefs format`, we can
 *    specify a source directory tree which will be copied over the new
 *    bcachefs filesytem.
 * 2. Migrating an existing filesystem in place, with `bcachefs migrate`.
 *    This will allocate space for the bcachefs metadata, but the actual data
 *    represented by the extents will not be duplicated. The bcachefs metadata
 *    will simply point to the existing extents.
 *
 * To avoid code duplication, `copy_fs` deals with both cases. See the function
 * documentation for more details.
